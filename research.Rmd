My research lies at the intersection of **cognitive science**, **neuroscience**, **philosophy**, and **language studies**. I investigate how humans attend to, interpret, and adapt to their environments, from neural mechanisms of attention and perception to the social and linguistic dimensions of understanding.

  
Some of my main research areas include:

- **Environmental Noise and Cognitive Variability**, modeled using **Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM)**
- **Attentional Control and Decision-making** in complex and noisy environments  
- **Computational Modeling** of cognitive strategies and attentional shifts 
- **Philosophy of Cognition and Mind**, especially where it intersects with emerging technologies and education  
- **Language, Narrative, and Embodiment** , how stories, rhythm, and movement shape understanding  
- **Science Communication and Pedagogy**, particularly within interdisciplinary and multilingual contexts
- **Speech-to-song Illusion** and the perceptual boundaries between speech and music 

I have collaborated with the **Music Cognition Group** at the ILLC and the **Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics Lab** at the Donders Institute.

This evolving research portfolio reflects my belief that cognition is not just a brain-bound process but one deeply entangled with culture, context, and communication.
